                    <h3>Important Milestones</h3>
                    <p>
                        Palestine Telecommunications Company/Jawwal was established in 1995 as a public shareholding
                        company, and its shares were listed on the Palestine Stock Exchange after obtaining a license
                        from the Palestinian Authority in 1996. It started its operations on January 1, 1997 as an
                        operator and provider of all types of innovative telecommunications services for fixed
                        telephones, the Internet, cloud computing services, managed services, and information security
                        in Palestine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1999, cellular communications services were launched in Palestine, with a call made by the
                        late President Yasser Arafat, equipped with the latest technologies reached by global
                        technology, to become the most efficient local provider, with a subscriber base exceeding three
                        million subscribers, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2005, the home ADSL service was launched, with the aim of providing subscribers with high
                        internet speeds, so that subscribers can enjoy internet services, through various and
                        encouraging campaigns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the beginning of 2023, in a major partnership with the Arab Bank, was set to launch the
                        first "Neo Bank" in Palestine with the aim of facilitating all banking and financial
                        transactions, to provide applications that simulate digital technology for subscribers and link
                        their various aspects of life, in line with global trends towards digitization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In parallel with these successes, the company continues its tireless efforts with local and
                        international partners to obtain its right to operate fourth and fifth generation services in
                        all governorates, to provide the highest internet speeds to its subscribers with the latest
                        technologies and services.
                    </p>
